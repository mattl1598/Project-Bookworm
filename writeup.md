## Analysis
### Background to and identification of problem
#### Overview of Scenario and Current User setup
Hampshire County Councils School Library Service loans large numbers of books (200+) to schools in Hampshire.
Their current system is limited to tracking number of books loaned.
The current system is managed using a group of "three?" excel spreadsheets for managing school data, 
subscription information and loan details. 

### Description of current system
