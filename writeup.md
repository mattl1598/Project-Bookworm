# AQA A Level Computer Science Project Writeup

## Analysis

### Introduction
Hampshire County Council's School Library Service (SLS) loans books to over 400 schools in Hampshire and has 4 centres
located in Basingstoke, Farnborough, Fareham and the New Forest.
The SLS provides various services as well, including loaning books and e-resources, 
training and advisory/support services.
The school's exchange books by visiting a centre or receiving delivery via a small fleet of vans.
The standard allocation of books is 3 per pupil at primary level and 2 per pupil at secondary with a maximum loan of 
200 books per exchange.

### Description of current system
Currently, the SLS only tracks the quantity of books at a given location using an excel spreadsheet for each 
centre and one tab for each school. Each tab contains the details about the school (listed below) as well as the details
of each exchange including the number of books and the date.
When a school visits a centre to exchange books, the library assistants at the centre physically count all of the books 
as they come in and go out and record this in the spreadsheet which then calculates the total for the school. 

The problem was researched by speaking with one of the library assistants as well as conducting a survey amongst the rest.
I also went to a showcase day for library management systems aimed for internal use in a school library. 
These use a similar principle to my project however they work on a different level with reference to 
different volumes of users and books. 

The main issue with the current system is that the library assistants have no way of knowing where books are located.
Currently a school can't request a list of books that they have since there is no tracking data available to look this up with.
Another issue is that one school is not supposed to have more than two copies of any book in particular but this is difficult
to manage since there isn't a list of what books they have to check against.

#### General Details for a School
Each school currently has it's own tab in the spreadsheet. At the top of each tab is a header containing information such as:
* School Name
* Head Teachers Name
* Address
* Contact Details
* The DfE Number (unique number assigned by the Department for Education to each school)
* Date of the Last Exchange
* Number of Pupils

Below these details, there is a table of the exchanges and details of them including:
* Date
* Comments/Notes
* Type of exchange
* Number of books returned
* Number of books issued

### Justification of chosen solution:

* Python with Tkinter GUI

I have chosen to use Python with Tkinter for the GUI as my method of choice for my project. I am using it because 
I know python quite well (compared to VB which is the only other language I have used before) and I have 
already learnt Tkinter as a GUI implementation for python as opposed to learning Kivy just for being able to 
easily put the program on mobile devices.

I also know that the users have Windows machines as their desk computers at the site meaning mobile 
devices aren't a required feature.

## Design
### Overall System Design
### Description of modular structure of system
#### Modules:
All of the code has been separated into different python modules (*.py).
These modules can be imported into other parts of the code to allow modularity in the structure of the program. 
The modules also reduce the amount of code needed to be written as they can imported to allow the calling of the functions inside the modules.
 
#### Objects:
Objects are callable by any other part of the code where the modules are imported. 

Some objects that I've implemented are:
* Entry form object
* book details object
* Homepage object
* Multientry form object
* settings menu object
* School Details View menu
* School Details Buttons menu

| Object:       | Description: |Uses:| Called by: | Calls: |
|---------------|--------------|------------|------------|--------|
| Entry Form    |For entering a single value to be processed.|Enering an ISBN to view the details of that book.|Homepage|Book Details|
| Book Details  |Displays the title, author, etc that is passed into the object.|Displaying the details of a book.|Entry Form|Homepage| 
| Homepage      |The main menu of the program. Has buttons to call each of the parts of the program.|Calling smaller independent parts of the program such as Settings and the Multientry form.|Starting the program, Book Details, Settings, Multientry, Entry Form.|Entry Form, Multientry, Settings Menu|

|School Details Init|Initialising the school details view object.|Opens the School Details View in new school mode for creating a new school or selecting an existing school|Homepage.|School Details View.|

##### Login Screen
![Login Screen](./gui-images/login.PNG "Login Screen")

This is the Login screen that is presented when the user opens the application or logs out from the homepage.
The menu is characterised by a pair of entry fields, one for the username and one for the password, as well a 
submit button. The button isn't the only way to run the authentication process as the user can also 
press `Enter` to submit the details as is standard of most login systems. The password field is obscured 
upon entry with asterisks (`*`) replacing each character as is standard with almost all Windows-based 
login systems as well as on many websites. When submitted, the password is hashed with an SHA512 cryptographic 
hash function before being compared with the hashed password associated with the given username that is 
stored in the databases login's table. 

##### Homepage
![Homepage](./gui-images/homepage.PNG)

This is the homepage for the application where the user can navigate to all of the various parts. The homepage 
is made up of various buttons linked to the different sections of the program. There are also buttons for 
`Log Off` and `Quit` to allow the user to end their unique session or to completely close the application
respectively. At the top of the window is the program name and logo and at the bottom is a welcome back 
message with the current username.

##### Book Details
![ISBN Entry](./gui-images/isbn-entry.PNG)

This part of the book details process is for taking the inputted isbn for a book and passing it through to the 
next section. The menu has a entry box for the isbn and a label above it to instruct the user on what to input.
Below the entry box is a button which will submit the contents of the entry box to the next bit of the 
Book Details section.

![Book Details](./gui-images/book-details.PNG)

This is the window that is used to display the details of a book. The details are pulled from either the sqlite
database if there is an entry for that isbn or the Google Books API if there isn't. The details that are available for 
being displayed are:
* Title (and subtitle if applicable)
* Author(s)
* Genre
* Release/Publish Date
* Age Rating
* Blurb
* Cover Image

and two placeholder fields for anything else requested by the end users.
At the bottom of the window are three buttons. One of these will save any changes made to the details by the 
user to the sqlite database. The next one will close this part of the program and return to the homepage of
the application. The last button will delete any entry in the database and allow the program to use the original 
Google Books data for the details.

##### School Details
![School Selection](./gui-images/school-select.PNG)

This window is for selecting a school to view or edit the details of or to add a new school to the system.
There are three buttons on the left of the window:
* `New School` for creating a profile of a new school in the database
* `View School` for viewing the details of an existing school profile
* `Edit School` for editing the details of an existing school profile

On the right of the window is drop down menu containing the list of existing school profiles to select from for
use in the `View School` or `Edit School` windows.

The School Details main window has three variants which are chosen in the previous window.
All of the variants are have the same fields to fill in or be viewed but they start differently depending 
on the variant.
The fields are:
* School Name
* Head Teacher
* Last Exchange
* Contact:
* DFE No'
* No' of Pupils
* Allocation per pupil
* Total Allocation
* Address
There is also a button next to the address field which will open Google Maps with the location of the school 
in the default web browser.
At the bottom of all of the variants is a button to close the details menu and return to the homepage.  

![New School](./gui-images/new-school.PNG)

The first variant of the School Details window is for create a new profile for a school. It has the same fields 
as the other variants but all are left blank for the user to fill in. At the bottom of the field is an 
`Add New School` button to save the entered details to the database as a new school.

![View School](./gui-images/view-school.PNG)

The second variant does not have editable field for the school name or a button to save changes as it is only 
for viewing the details of a chosen school.

![Edit School](./gui-images/edit-school.PNG) 

The third and final variant is for changing the details of a school. As such, it starts with all of the details fields 
filled with the details in the database ready for being changed by the user and has a `Save Changes` button 
at the bottom for committing any changes to the database. 

##### Sign Out Books

![Multi-Entry Selection](./gui-images/multientry-selection.PNG)

This window is for selecting a school to sign books out to or in from. It has a list of the schools in the 
system in a drop down menu to select one and two buttons to choose whether you're signing books in or out with 
respect to that location.

![Multi-Entry Main](./gui-images/multibook-sign-in.PNG)

This window has a single entry box for entering an isbn of a book. The user enters the ISBN and presses the 
`Enter` key. This puts the ISBN in the list box on the left and collects the title from the database or the 
Google Books API and puts it in the list on the right to help make sure the correct book has been entered.
Once all of the ISBNs are entered, the user clicks on the `Sign In`/`Sign Out` button which will sign the 
books out to the location selected in the previous window.

##### Settings

![Settings](./gui-images/settings.PNG)

This window is where the user can change any settings pertaining to the application that might need to 
be modified. 
The first setting is the application-wide theme option. This is changed via a drop down menu with a list of the 
available themes that can be chosen from.
The next setting is the location of the sqlite database. This is chosen via a file path to the database file 
which can be selected via the Windows Open File dialog. The next setting is the root folder location for the 
program to use as a file location for the temporary storage of cover images for books and long term storage of 
icons required for the program.
The last setting is an `Add New User` button for creating a new user profile which can be used on the login 
screen to access the application. This setting is only available to accounts with administrator privileges.
